# GameBackend

This is not a game backend. This was meant to be a learning project, but there were too many things I wanted to learn all at once, so this repo is kind of dead.

This repo's main value to me now is showing an interesting example of how to organize (over-engineer?) your database access layer (DAL), and an artifact of how I set up an open-source REST service framework in java.

This repo also motivated a couple of more focused learning projects:
* https://github.com/fridge-dev/CreateUserLambda A serverless API for user credentials and authentication
* https://github.com/fridge-dev/lost-cities-game A 1v1 online turn-based game, written in rust
* https://github.com/fridge-dev/frj-game-ngn A more generalized online turn-based game engine, written in rust
